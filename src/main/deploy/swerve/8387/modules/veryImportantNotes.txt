To get correct offsets for swerve modules:
    -Turn all swerve modules forward with the bevel gear on the left
    -Connect to the robot
    -Open Shuffleboard
    -The absolute encoder offset for that module is equal to the absolute angle value for that module in Shuffleboard
    -Make sure that:
        -The IDs for everything in the json files are correct and match with what phoenix tuner and Shuffleboard tell you
        -The appropriate values in shuffleboard change when you move the appropriate module around
